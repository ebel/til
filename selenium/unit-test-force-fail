# Force fail when something does not go right

Often times when creating functional tests, I want to force the failure of a test if an element is not found.

This does it for me:

    try:
        login_error_text = WebDriverWait(self.browser, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "has-error")))
    except TimeoutException, e:
        self.fail("Could not find error classname in html")
